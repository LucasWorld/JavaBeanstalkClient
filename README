This is JavaBeanstalkClient, a Java Client for beanstalkd

See http://xph.us/software/beanstalkd for general info

To build JavaBeanstalkClient, type "mvn install"

This client library is designed to operate with other client libraries; 
hence jobs are opaque byte arrays, job ids require the use of a Java long (to support 
unsigned ints up to 2**32), etc. 

The implementation of the library is based upon the design of the Python beanstalkc at
